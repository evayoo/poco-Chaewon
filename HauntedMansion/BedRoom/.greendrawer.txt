You found the a golden necklace with a white horse pendant. 

I found this necklace. 

"Darling, if you sell this necklace, you will have enough money to pay for the course fee" 

Thank you so much! 

You sold the necklace, and earned 9000 CHF. You paid the course fee of 7000 CHF, and give the rest back to Bern the bear. Everybody is happy.
