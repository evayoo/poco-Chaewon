Bern the bear is sitting up there. Go near her and give her a kiss, and the lemon cake you baked with the tea. 

Bern the bear says, 
"Thank you my loved one, lemon cake is my favorite food. 
I wanted to eat this for a long long time. Thank you. 
I heard you got into PowerCoders, my darling." 

Yes, actually I couldn't pay for the course fee yet. 

"Ah, darling, I will help you. Go to the closet."
