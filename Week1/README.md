GIt hub 

Push commits to GitHub
git push -u origin main - first time
git push - after that
The very first time we push a commit we have to tell Git exactly how these two repositories (local and GitHub) are linked, including how they branch.

The -u flag is used to set origin as the upstream remote in your git config. You only have to do that the first time and then can use push and pull without arguments.

You will probably be prompted for credentials or an authentication token.

Git

cd
cd [folder_name]: moves down into the folder
cd [path_name]: moves down into the last folder listed
cd ..: moves up one folder level

cd ../../../: moves up three folder levels
cd ~: moves to your home directory, no matter where you are
